Power distribution and control board for the WRC Surface Vessel

  The Surface Vessel Relay Power Control Board is used to control and distribute raw battery power in the 12-24V range to four downstream VESC motor control boards. 
 The power can be enabled/disabled manually with an on-board PCB mount switch, or controlled with two logic level inputs acting as a set/reset flip flop.  The boards status is represented by an on-board led and off-board LED connection for a lighted switch.
